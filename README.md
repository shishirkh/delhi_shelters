# Delhi Shelters

Sharing the code for everyone to contribute and make use of the raw data provided by the gov.

The Delhi Gov. has released a list of places where provisions of night shelters and free food has been made by them to help everyone in this difficult time. They have also released a maps web-page for giving the locations. Unfortunately they have not used Google Maps due to which Navigation and knowing the exact location is difficult.  I have used their list and maps web-pages to find and compile the Google maps links of the places. It will be helpful for anyone who wants to reach the place. I have also sorted it according to areas in Delhi.  

List shared by the Delhi CM - http://delhishelterboard.in/occupancy-report/index-ag2.php

List created by me using web scraping and regex matching - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GLmmmwmjGu77BI1-LeY7A-Zoekvm2sKnO8XpWCDPF_w/edit?usp=sharing 

About the python code:-
map_scrapper.py -> This scraps the map webpage of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board and collects the google maps links of all.
raw_plus_maps_data_compiler.py -> This combines the raw data available at http://delhishelterboard.in/occupancy-report/index-ag2.php (like capacity,district of the shelter) with the google maps links.
